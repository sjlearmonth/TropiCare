              <h2 class="fish-heading">The Neon Tetra</h2>
              <h3 class="fish-description">Neons are among the most popular freshwater tropical fish due to their tiny size
                and vibrant colors. They only grow about an inch or so long, and are a great fish
                for a 10-gallon tank or bigger.</h3>
              <h3 class="fish-description">These little guys are schooling fish, which means you want to have at least six of
                them, preferably more. When their school is too small, or when the water is poor, they can get nippy at each
                other.</h3>
              <h3 class="fish-description">Otherwise, they are an extremely docile and easy-to-care-for fish species,
                well suited to beginner and advanced fishkeepers alike. Beware not to stock them with larger fish,
                because they make a tempting snack. One rule to remember when choosing fish: Big fish eat little fish!</h3>

              <h2 class="fish-heading">The Swordtail</h2>
              <h3 class="fish-description">Swords are another pretty species that will grow to about two inches in length.
                They’re peaceful community fish, though fairly active. You can tell the males apart from the
                females by the elongated “swords” on their tails, hence their name.</h3>
              <h3 class="fish-description">While these guys aren’t aggressive, you may notice the male relentlessly
                harassing the female. It’s just his way of showing swordtail love, but it can be fairly stressful
                for her. One solution is to have at least two female swordtails for every male.</h3>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <h2 class="fish-heading">The Fancy Guppy</h2>
              <h3 class="fish-description">Guppies have tiny little bodies, and long, flowing fins. They come in many
                different vibrant colors, and a tank with several types of guppies in it really pops. They’re super
                active though, so if a calm, tranquil tank is what you’re going for these fish may not be for you.</h3>
              <h3 class="fish-description">But if you like a lot of action and pretty colors in your aquarium you might
                even consider stocking it only with guppies.</h3>
              <h3 class="fish-description">Be aware that they’re very small and, like neons, not a good choice if you
                have larger fish in your tank. They’re also livebearers, so if you do have a bunch of them be on the
                lookout for baby guppies in your tank one day!</h3>

        <h2 class="tank-header">Aquarium Tank</h2>
        <h3 class="tank-description">Readying your home for pet fish can vary in difficulty depending on how many
          fish you'd like to keep as well as how much space you have available. Fish tanks can range in capacity
          from just 0.5 gallons to over 200 gallons. As aquarium size increases, weight, maintenance difficulty,
          and space requirements increase steeply. Before you buy, consider the benefits and drawbacks of all the
          fish tank sizes and aquarium sizes available.</h3>
        <h3 class="tank-description">When shopping for an aquarium, look at the "Weights & Dimensions" tab for a
          tank's exact L x W x H dimensions as well as its weight when empty and its water capacity. Tanks of the
          same capacity aren't one-size-fits-all. They can vary in shape, so it's very important to look at the
          exact dimensions to ensure you have enough space before you buy. Keep in mind that you'll need a few
          inches above your aquarium for feeding purposes, maintenance, and accessories like tank hoods.</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="cabinet-container">
        <img class="cabinet-image" src="images/tank-cabinet.jpeg" alt="Tank cabinet image" />
        <h2 class="cabinet-header">Tank Cabinet</h2>
        <h3 class="cabinet-description">All aquariums must be placed on aquarium specific cabinets, and
          manufacturer’s warranties may be void if a heavy aquarium full of water is supported by unsuitable
          home furniture.</h3>

        <h3 class="cabinet-description">In the worst case the furniture underneath may collapse. Instead choose
          the proper cabinet for your make and model of tank, which has been designed specifically to support
          its weight.</h3>

        <h3 class="cabinet-description">Cabinets benefit aquariums in other ways too, as they offer a place out
          of sight to place external power filters - the best filter option for a tropical or coldwater freshwater
          tank, and also to place pots of food, test kits, and all those plugs and cables. </h3>

          <h3 class="cabinet-description">Water is heavy. Keep in mind water adds approximately 8lbs per gallon.
            Therefore, as a guide a 10 gal tank weighs approximately 80 lbs and a 20 gal approximately 160lbs.
            Then you have the weight of the tank itself and gravel on the bottom of the tank.</h3>

          <h3 class="cabinet-description">You can then choose a finishing style, to fit in with your decor. Some
            people prefer one material like wood or steel, while others like a combination. A metal finish is
            often preferred because of its modern look and it’s easy to clean. Steel is also rust coated, unlike
            wood which will swell if it absorbs water and isn’t properly coated for protection.</h3>
